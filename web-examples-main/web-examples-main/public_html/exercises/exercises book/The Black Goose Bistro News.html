            <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
            <p>posted by BGB <time datetime="2016-11-15">November 15, 2016</time> </p>
            <p>
                This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called <i> sous vide</i>. In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set
                to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In this book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low temperature poaching.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                Next month, we will be serving <b><i> Sous Vide </i>Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before
